Thanks so much for your interest in Kwiqet! By clicking the link below, you can get started on the Alpha process. This part of a product rollout is the first step, and it is meant to be held among friends and family exclusively. Your notes and comments can help us build a better Kwiqet for the Beta users (our next step) and the eventual mass-market launch.

Basically, you're going to be asked a few questions in order to see if you qualify to be an Alpha user based on your location, level of awesome and height--just kidding. Well, about the second two...

Being an Alpha user is important for any young product--but in our case, if you join the "Alpha Squad" (we'll provide you with matching "Alpha Squad" stamp-on tattoos in the mail) it's even cooler than usual. That's because every two weeks Abextra hosts super-fun free events that we learn about from Kwiqet's "Smart Events" list, and all Alpha users are invited! 

I hope we can share this experience with you; should you become an Alpha user you will be of enormous help to us. I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback!
