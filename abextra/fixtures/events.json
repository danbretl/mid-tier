Tomorrow night's eight-hour this-is-your-life extravaganza takes place in IPR's current Can Factory space. Beginning at 5 p.m., it includes works featuring Sharp's Orchestra Carbon ( Flexagons ), his electronics-rocking Bootstrappers, a brain-scrambling eleven-guitar version of SyndaKit, excerpts from Sharp's Octal for eight-string guitarbass, and a screening of Bert Shapiro's E# documentary,  Doing the Don't.

So it's no wonder that what's lately been of interest to her are the fairy tales of Charles Perrault. In 2009, Breillat adapted his story  Bluebeard , about a husband who murders his disobedient wives, to explore the dangerous lessons learned by the story's young female readers. And now she presents  The Sleeping Beauty , which looks at mythologies told throughout history of little girls in danger. Tonight, the outspoken Breillat will discuss  The Sleeping Beauty  at a screening as a part of the 16th annual  Rendez-Vous With French Cinema  series, presented by Unifrance. You can also catch the filmmaker on Monday at IFC (323 Sixth Avenue) for a screening and discussion about Elia Kazan's very naughty  Baby Doll , which concerns a husband whose sultry child bride won't allow him to touch her. We're sure she'll have plenty to say about that.",
