It was originally called the Manhattan Opera House. After a few changes in ownership, the Grand Ballroom was added to the roof of the existing opera house. Today, the original part of the theatre is called the Hammerstein Ballroom. The Hammerstein Ballroom NYC is particularly unique because it is a two-tiered venue with an adjustable capacity that is dependent on the configuration of the production. The Hammerstein Ballroom NYC is additionally known for its elegance and impeccable acoustic design.</p><p>Due to the on-premise television & recording studios, post-production suites and optional production services, the popularity of the Hammerstein Ballroom NYC with the creme de la creme of the arts world, should come as no surprise.</p><p>\nIn addition to Grammy Award-winning recordings and Oscar-winning orchestral sets, the Hammerstein Ballroom schedule also includes industry events such as fashion shows, product launches and award shows to name but a few.</p><p>\nFor all the latest news and up-to-date information on what&#39;s on at the Hammerstein Ballroom NYC, make Eventful your source, and check out the Hammerstein Ballroom schedule above.</p>",

The Izod Center&#39;s concert schedule is constantly full of hit musicians -- especially Bruce Springsteen -- because the arena was built specifically to enhance the acoustics of performers; and because Izod doesn&#39;t charge nearly as much in facility fees.  This has led to infamous performances by The Boss, The Grateful Dead, Kiss, and Queen at this East Rutherford arena.\n\nAlso known as the Meadowlands Arena due to its location in the Meadowlands Sports Complex, the Izod Center was built in 1981 and sits just ten minutes from Teterboro Airport.  When the arena&#39;s schedule isn&#39;t full of superstar musicians, the Izod Center also hosts a variety of family and sporting events, including the NCAA Division 1 Fordham Rams.  The venue also offers a full list of amenities plus a Parents&#39; Waiting Room for concerts and a fine dining restaurant called the Winners Club, making it the premier entertainment destination in East Rutherford.  \n\nAudiences looking for a venue that hosts the biggest names in music need look no further than the Izod Center.  For the arena&#39;s full calendar of events, just check the schedule on Eventful.",
