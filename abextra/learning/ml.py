 This module contains all the Machine Learning algorithms that get applied to -
 the CategoryTree to generate recommendations.
 All algorithms follow the same fundamental structure:
     a) Required input is a CategoryTree.
     b) Each function works on a parent and its children.
     c) Each function may be applied top_down_recursive or bottom_up_recursive.
     d) Each function only writes to the CategoryTree dictionary.
 The most main function is get_event_recommendations(user) which is called by 
 the middle tier.
 It returns a set of events as recommendations.
 All default values and functions are defined in settings.py.
 #ToDo: 
 Migrate all default values and functions from settings.py into LiveSettings

 Assumptions:
    1) Each event is assigned only a single Concrete category and 
       potentially multiple abstract categories.
